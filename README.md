# Welcome to the Repo for Julian's CompNeuro DiRP Group! ðŸ§ 

> Curious about the computational foundations of human experience and how neuroscience and AI drive each otherâ€™s advancements? In the Computational Neuroscience mentorship group, weâ€™ll explore recent research on the development and function of intelligent biological systems, discuss what the results can teach us about enhancing AI, and examine how AI, in turn, can deepen our understanding of the brain.

That includes topics like engrammatic representations of memory, the workings of the hippocampus, infant learning through synaptic pruning, and much more!

***NO background in biology required!***

This journal club will run in tandem with *Longhorn Neurotech's Journal Club*, which I am also leading.

### **STRUCTURE SUBJECT TO CHANGE**

This DiRP group will be structured as a journal club. Once a week, we will meet to discuss papers/videos about a specified topic in computational neuroscience. These topics will be influenced by the interests of group members. I'm always open to exploring new areas, so suggestions for topics are highly encouraged!

For now, feel free to check out the [Resources](./Resources) folder for some papers we may be going over! Some of these topics are highly complimented by [Artem Kirsanov's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ArtemKirsanov/featured), so I recommend watching some of these as well (they have very nice animations too).

### A Little About Me:

Iâ€™m a fourth-year student double majoring in Computer Science and the Neuroscience Scholars Program with a minor in Business. Iâ€™m a founding member of the DMIC labâ€™s AI and neuroimaging team and currently serve as the Research and Development Lead at Longhorn Neurotech. I plan to pursue a PhD focused on using brain organoids as models for brain-computer interfaces (BCI). In my free time, I produce music and rock climb!

### Calendar ðŸ“…:

- **9/20:**
  - Will be a basic introduction to neuroscience (behavior of individual neurons and neurons in groups). We will also pick the topic for the next meeting.
  - <a href = "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rGYJxhl2N0D2FNJOnoF-xJ-zQfPaJh2zwuNdMoSgMsI/edit?usp=sharing">*Link to slides*</a>
- **9/27:**
  - We will go over [**this paper**](./Resources/Papers/DishBrainPong.pdf), in which a group of biological neurons on a dish are trained to play Pong! It's an example of "wetware", a new model of computation using biological components.
  - The paper is super dense, so [**here's an article**](https://www.the-scientist.com/how-neurons-in-a-dish-learned-to-play-pong-70613) which breaks it down into simpler terms!
  - <a href = "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iz_SYq0NYGrq0YfkLSErbl9jSAySaIkDWhEURsWTnTs/edit?usp=sharing">*Link to slides*</a>
- **10/4:**
  - We will go over the engramatic representation of memory- that is, how our memories are physically stored, accessed, and manipulated in the brain.
  - The paper [**The 21st Century Engram**](./Resources/Papers/The21stCenturyEngram.pdf) is a good overview of the current understanding of memory.
  - And here is a wonderful [**youtube video**](https://youtu.be/X5trRLX7PQY?si=1ofxL2JtGfRwC-gI](https://youtu.be/X5trRLX7PQY?si=dJ873_7poR_nqoEj)) that also goes over the basics of memory storage. I highly recommend watching it!
  - <a href = "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DnlYgj_ugCe51C9Y0mnG64ZxvuUtP56IDNZAvMtNsDo/edit?usp=sharing">*Link to slides*</a>
- **10/11:**
  - We will go over the work of recent Physics nobel prize winners Hopfield and Hinton! As neuroscientists/computer scientists, its a bit strange that they were awarded the physics prize, but Hopfield Networks and Boltzman Networks are foundational to AI (oh, and backpropogation. Hinton helped write the paper on that too).
  - The [**paper**](./Resources/Papers/HopfieldNetworks.pdf) is the work John Hopfield published in 1982 describing the "Hopfield Network," for which he just won a Nobel prize.
  - And here is a good [**youtube video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piF6D6CQxUw) explaining the basics of the network.
  - <a href = "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kJrykHlhN18VeOhUrec_wksKW7xvblnEbsVh6gKUCoE/edit?usp=sharing">*Link to slides*</a>
- **10/18:**
  - No meeting (I'm out of town!)
- **10/25:**
  - We will go over the [**Tolman-Eichanbaum machine**](./Resources/Papers/Tolman-Eichenbaum-Machine.pdf)! This is an AI representation of our own Hippocampal formation (Entorhinal Cortex + Hippocampus) and proves a valuable tool for understanding how our own memory works.
  - Here is the [video](https://youtu.be/cufOEzoVMVA?si=u0HbBV30mBRnR5GQ) we went over, and here is the [Part 1](https://youtu.be/9qOaII_PzGY?si=-R0TiIzgrrqFXpzY) that we skipped over.
  - <a href = "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EBR87amddD_0CPwXSi67xEkY7R1iZ821CUHM2U2Bb84/edit?usp=sharing">*Link to slides*</a>
- **11/1:**
  - We will go over a recent paper from UT's own Huth Lab: [**Semantic reconstruction of continuous language from non-invasive brain recordings**](./Resources/Papers/SemanticReconstructionFromBrainRecordings.pdf). This is a paper that shows an applied use of computational neuroscience- "mind reading."
